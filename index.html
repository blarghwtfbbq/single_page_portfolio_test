            Welcome to my website!
            I spent the past 2 years doing a deep dive into data science, focusing upon analytics and machine learning.
            My goal is to learn and develop a better understanding of the tools available to analyze and visualize data.
            In the meantime, I am gaining more experience in applicaton and presentation layers.
            And just maybe, I could integrate them into my workflow...or at least competently explain what I want to someone who could build the necessary tools!
